## Resources
* I did not use any outside resources other than extensive consultations with Richard Kalehoff - Thanks for the help!

## Deductions
I reviewed the list of deductions for this project and in the syllabus.

## Comments
* I clearly struggled with the JavaScript portion of the assignment, obviously I need much more practice.
* I was a little confused with the branches since the last instruction was to create function branch, all of my JavaScript is located in that branch, not the master.
* Since I had started this project prior to the other assignment being graded, I was unable to correct the incorrect format for commit messages you mentioned in the notes.
* Thanks for all your help.
